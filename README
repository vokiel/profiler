Modified KohanaPHP 3.0 profiler: - shows number of returned rows for mysql queries - shows $COOKIE, $GET, $POST, $SESSION - optionally shows $_SERVER, included files, loaded modules.

Changed the way profiler shows memory usage (using Text::bytes method), by default profiler is hidden, clicking on the Show Profiler link opens it.
